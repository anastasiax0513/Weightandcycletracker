## Step 3: Use the App

Once installed:
- **Launch the app** from your home screen like any other app
- **All your data is saved locally** on your device using localStorage
- **Works offline** (after the initial load, when deployed with a service worker)
- **Looks and feels like a native app** - no browser UI!

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the install prompt"
- Make sure you're using **HTTPS** (your deployed URL should start with `https://`)
- Try clearing your browser cache
- On iPhone, you **must use Safari**
- Some browsers may not show the prompt immediately - refresh the page

### "The app won't work offline"
- Service workers (for offline functionality) only work in deployed environments
- They won't work in preview mode or localhost
- Once deployed, visit the app once while online, then it will cache for offline use

### "I can't find the app icon"
- Check your home screen pages
- On Android, check your app drawer
- Try the installation process again

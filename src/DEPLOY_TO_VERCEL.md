## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

- Verify `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json` exist
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard for specific errors

### App Not Loading?
- Clear your browser cache
- Check the Vercel deployment logs
- Make sure the build was successful (green checkmark in Vercel)

### Service Worker Not Working?
- Service workers only work on HTTPS (Vercel provides this automatically)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't Install as PWA?
- Make sure you're accessing via the Vercel HTTPS URL
- On iOS, use Safari browser

- The `manifest.json` should be accessible at `your-url.vercel.app/manifest.json`
